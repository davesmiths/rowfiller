-------------

Known to work in:

* Safari iOS 7
* IE 7, 8, 9, 10

If a browser or version isn't here then it hasn't been tested; more tests welcomed.


How it works
------------

 - Items only have other item siblings
 - Concept of rows, columns and items
     - a row is a set of columns with the same offset top
     - a column contains one or more items
     - an item is a page element which can be moved elsewhere in a page and still retain it's look and feel
